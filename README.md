# Mac Bootstrap

This project consists of a series of scripts to help you set up a new installation of Mac OS X.

The installation is opinionated and Web Development focused, so make sure you read the scripts before running anything.

To get started, simply run `./bootstrap.sh` from anywhere on your filesystem.
